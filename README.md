#AI-Powered Text Generation/Summarizer made with FAST API

FastAPI backend that provides two basic AI features:

Generate Text: Create a short continuation from a starting prompt.

Summarize Text: Pick out the most important sentences from a longer passage.

Itâ€™s built with clear, modular code, uses minimal dependencies, and has CORS enabled so a frontend can connect easily. You can run it locally and extend it later with more advanced AI tools if needed.
